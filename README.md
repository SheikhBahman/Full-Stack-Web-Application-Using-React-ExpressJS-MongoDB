Sports Analytics for Predicting Baseball Teams and Players Performance.

This project is a statistical investigation to analyze and predict performance of a sport team and players. The project is submitted as a group project for STAT 420 Statistical Modeling in R course at UIUC.

# Introduction
## Why sports analytic?
Sports analytics is one of the most demanding topics in statistical modeling these days. Different sport teams invest lots of money on their team each year. They need to evaluate carefully how they choose and who they need in different posts, what playing strategies works better for their team, e.g. offensive, defensive in order to spend less but achieve more. The team managers use these statistical models to determine what characteristics make a college player become a robust professional player as well as many other crucial questions and decisions they need to make each season. Sports analytics are a combination of historical events, statistical analysis, simulations and modeling according to a team's individual players, teams tactics and teams opponents that when properly analyzed and applied in the team can provide a competitive advantage to a team or even the individual players. By analyzing this data, sports analytics inform players and coaches in order to improve and aid in decision making both during, prior and post game. According to Wikipedia the term “sports analytics” was spread in typical sports culture following the release of the 2011 movie Moneyball, the Oakland Athletics team of 2002 created history by winning 20 consecutive games between August 13 and September 20 2002. Much of the Oakland Athletics success in that season is credited to a graduate in Economics from Harvard University joining the team in 1999 and implementing analysis of baseball statistics to assess and purchase players. Sports analytics helps sport teams make better, informed decisions which increases the performance of a sport team through better resource management. On top of that with sports analytics team managers can save or even makes money for the club by wisely investing on the players, finding unknown talent or find weaknesses in another player or a team. Hence these days sports analytics is rapidly becoming an essential element in the success of sports teams.

## Statement of personal interest
In this project we decided to enter the interesting and fast evolving field of data science. Our objective for this project is to statistically investigate the different critical features of baseball teams and players and find the significant ones to be able to predict the performance of a baseball team and/or performance of a player within a confidence level. Base on statistical data our main intention is to answer the following questions:

* Predict a player’s batting average, to assess the player quality for the post.
* Statistically predict how does a team make the playoffs?
* What evidences make a team more winner?
* How does a team score more runs?
* Develop a predictive model.

Some definitions: At-bats or batting average of a baseball player is the ratio of his number of hits to his number of opportunities-to-hit. Professional baseball players typically have at-bats average somewhere between 0.20 and 0.30. The player’s at-bats in a given year can be predicted by his cumulative history of performance and it can be considered as a critical feature of a professional player. On the other hand, features such as the number of runs allowed, runs scored, on base percentage, and slugging percentage of a team are the main features to evaluate the performance of a baseball team in the season. According to the statistical analysis a baseball team required 90 to 100 wins in order to make it to the playoffs. A team typically needs to score 800 to 820 runs and allow 600-650 runs in order to make it to postseason.

In this project we intend to utilize the knowledge we gained in the course to analyze and understand how a statistical method can be used to develop a predictive model in sports analytics. We will use R to first clean and prepare the data and study the distribution of each individual predictor and identify any possible outliers. Then we will investigate the significance of our predictors to predict wins of a baseball team and the batting average of a baseball player based on our predictors. We will use model selection techniques: BIC and AIC considering adjusted R squared and LOOCV RMSE measures for a multiple linear regression and/or polynomial regression. At the end we will investigate the different informative criteria for a baseball team to make to playoff, postseason or championship.
